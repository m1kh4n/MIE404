 1 DOF Helicopter PID Control

Project Memebers: Ishaq Khan(Me), Arham Danish, Vincent Po Chou, Bilal Khan.

Description: We designed a 1 degree of freedom helicopter that behaves like a pendulum. The design has a single fan to control the angle of the rotating arm. The setup uses a motor and propeller to control the angle which in conjunction with the encoder that measures the angle output of the rotating arm, allows us to apply control logic through our arduino to tune our system and reach a desired output.
